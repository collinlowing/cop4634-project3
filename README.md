## TODO List
1. Create N threads for each lizard
2. Create 2 more threads for the number of cats

4. Lizard will wake up and cross the street for some random amount of seconds
5. The lizard will then eat for some random amount of seconds when it crosses the street safely
6. Then the lizard will return back home and cross the street again
7. The lizard will then sleep for some random amount of time, repeat at step 4
8. Set a maximum simultaneous lizards to cross the road at one time
9. The two cats will sleep for some random time
10. The each cat will then wake and if there are higher than the maximum number of lizards crossing the road, the program will terminate 
## Requirements
1. in lizards.cpp, when making changes add comments with initials
2. Do not delete code in lizards.cpp
3. Make a report named analysis.pdf
## Report
1. A short description of the problem
2. How your code changes solve it the problem
3. A discussion of all the changes made to the code
4. A table with results from multiple runs with different run times (constant WORLDEND in the source code) for the simulation
5. Issues encountered in developing the solution
